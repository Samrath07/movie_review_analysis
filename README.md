A small web app built with a **Flask API** and **React** front-end, to classify
a given movie review as either positive or negative. The app utilizes online
learning to actively train the classifier

The classifier is a simple logistic regression classifier from [ski-kit
learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), that was tuned using grid search.
